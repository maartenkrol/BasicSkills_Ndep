    "* A constant $LAI$ in the Jarvis approach.\n",
    "* Stress functions $F_2, F_3$ and $F_4$ in the Jarvis approach all equal 1.\n",
    "* Parameter values may be uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing parameterizations to improve the model, it is of course interesting to see how important the changes are. Therefore, always write down a few important statistics (e.g., annual total deposition flux) or keep a few graphs in a separate document. Keep it practical, do not try to keep track of too many things, a few key numbers or figures is usually enough. Let's now improve our model."

    "## 4.4 Parameter uncertainty and missing processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows us to calculate the resistance and deposition rates with many decimals, suggesting high accuracy. However, the real accuracy is far less determined by the numerical accuracy than by the accuracy of the (meteorological and air quality) input data, the choice of parameter values and the processes included in the model description. In the discussion section of your PGO report, you will have to consider sources of uncertainty. To prevent you from writing vague sentences like ‘the deposition fluxes are uncertain, because we did not know the exact parameter values’, do some sensitivity studies, where you vary the value of parameters with -10% and +10% or where you exclude/include some processes (e.g., deposition on wet canopy). Note how much the deposition flux changes. If this is less than 10%, the model may not be very sensitive to that parameter or process. But there will also be parameters or processes the model is more than proportionally sensitive to."
